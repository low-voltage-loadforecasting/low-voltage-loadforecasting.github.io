We provide voltage and current readings for aggregated circuits and matching fully-labeled ground truth data (individual appliance measurements). The dataset contains 53 appliances (17 classes) in a 3-phase power grid. BLOND-50 contains 213 days of uninterrupted measurements sampled at 50 kSps (aggregate) and 6.4kSps (individual appliances). BLOND-250 consists of the same setup: 50 days, 250 kSps (aggregate), 50 kSps (individual
appliances). These are the longest continuous measurements at such high sampling rates and fully-labeled ground truth we are aware of.
